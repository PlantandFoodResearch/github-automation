Then the provenance app was added as a wrapper on the top to link the dynamic_models app into kea. The models in the dynamic_models app are monkey patched to appear like they are part of the provenance app. The DynamicModel model is actually appears in the django admin called \"Provenance definitions\" under the provenance app. Ping me on gtalk if you want me to explain it in more detail.\n",

The problem I see is that through tables change the behaviour of the [ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/db/models/#intermediary-manytomany) and I can see many problems with them and a dynamic model/admin/import & export approach.\n\nA possible solution, that needs more thought, might be a custom M2M field that always uses the same through table in the way I described, but does not change the default ORM M2M behaviour. The field could filter out sample ids that already have associations, avoiding unique constraint exceptions that would defo pop up otherwise.\n\nAny thoughts?\n",

Obviously this Plant has a location that does not match those filters. I'm not sure how that happened. It shouldn't be possible unless creating or updating the plant using raw sql.\n\nThere are different ways to fix this.\n\n1) Either we remove the limit_choices_to dict and allow a plant to have any location. \n2) We update the PlantAdminForm and filter the locations queryset with those same limit_choice_to dict filters.\n\n2 does not actually fix the problem because the location would still not be valid, it would just show a more useful error message. Also, another problem with 2 is that specific locations would be unvalid but the user would still be able to choose those invalid locations with the datagrid and would not be informed the location is invalid until the form is saved. To fix the problem using 2 and do it properly is actually rather difficult.\n\nI'll wait and hear your thoughts on this.\n",

This means we will need to have a means of creating sets of location-types.\nAnd _that_ means that we need to create two new tables:\n- a location-type-set table \n- and a many to many to location-type.\n\nThen we can ensure that only location-types from a particular set are allowed in particular contexts.\nI do believe that we will eventually need this but right now it would be just too much.\n\nSo...\nOption 1 is the correct one for now.\n",

Standing unit tests run without errors and I've done a fair bit of user testing acting within both crop and provenance. Here's a list of stuff that I see as working now on the provenance branch.\n- initialise sample batch\n- create process run\n- view and select process runs\n- view and search plates\n- view and search batch spreadsheets with filtered columns\n- sample edit and search views show filtered fields/columns\n\nIn user testing I find that in stepping through processes in a process run errors arise because the process expects a plant (or population or genotype). I'm certainly at the point to be working on process runs and sorting these problems out.\n\nI'm using keadbdev_20140909 as my database dump before running migrate. I've gained a bit of control over my elasticsearch instance with 3rd party plugins but still come across problems that I solve by deleting and rebuilding the indices.\n\nCheers,\nDarryl\n",

The result for 100 samples with the old method is:\n\n```\n>>> reset_queries()\n>>> def make_docs_old():\n...     for sample in Sample.objects.all():\n...         doc = SampleMappingType.extract_document(sample)\n>>> timeit.timeit(make_docs, number=10)\n13.682330131530762\n>>> len(connection.queries)\n14010\n```\n\nAnd my new method:\n\n```\n>>> reset_queries()\n>>> def make_docs_new():\n...     for sample in Sample.objects.all():\n...         doc = SampleMappingType.new_extract(sample)\n>>> timeit.timeit(make_docs, number=10)\n3.682511920928955\n>>> len(connection.queries)\n1010\n```\n\nThere is some small variations in the results but the new method takes consistently around 30% of the time.\n\nI spent around 3 hours on the method (and I need some more testing to ensure that I'm correctly indexing altnames in particular).\n\nI estimate then around 3-4 hours per mapping type (of which there are 9 in total).\n\nIs this worth me doing?\n\nThe other point of optimisation could also be updagrading to Django 1.6 which will also help. From William:\n\nFrom what I've read this is what Django uses to check for the existence of a particular record. I mentioned this earlier about how django preforms a select before update. This is silly and the behaviour actually changed in Django 1.6.\n\nCheers,\nDarryl\n",

This will be a lot easier. \nIt will mean that, at least, people can fix their initial mistakes.\n\nIn the long run we can either allow for addition of new samples and just add them or delete samples carefully, recursively working our way through the processrun structure.\nBut this is likely to take a lot of effort to do right.\n\n(this test writing looks useful already :-) )\n",

A possible solution would be to create a PersonResource.\n\nHowever, I'm still having serious doubts about using this multi-sheet import for creating the (e.g) 'harvest samples' in sample initialisation. I do understand that it is a better workflow for users to have a single multisheet spreadsheet rather than forcing them to sort out their companies, trial plots, vineyard blocks etc through /provenance/admin/ **before** sample initialisation but this will certainly be a more robust solution.

Later a request was made for a 'custom' admin for a provenance which gives the user excel upload for each of the tables individually and avoids the problems of creating objects on the fly. I added a note on github for this issue suggesting that the multisheet upload on sample initialisation be dumped and only having the single sheet for say 'harvest' import to initialise samples (as for example the crop sample initialisation).\n",

Item'] in self.populations.keys():\nKeyError: 'From Ped. Item'\n```\n\nIt looked like the spreadsheet was missing a column that it needed to do the job.\nSo I hunted around trying to find where the checks were done to ensure that the spreadsheet complies with the minimum requirements for the upload.\n\nAnd I can't find anywhere where this is happening.\n\"ebrida_import.parse_sheet\" seems to be the sensible place to apply these checks but there is no sign of spreadsheet validation here. The spreadsheet sheet is read but it just dumps the contents into an array of dictionaries as is.\n\nPresenting the user with an opaque error is not very useful so I think we need to capture this as the spreadsheets produced by EBrida are completely user defined and need to be defined absolutely correctly for our import.\n",

Dry run did not check uniqueness of latlong, but did display nice user error on 'complete' but without creating objects.\n2. The 'to be created' user feedback is not working as expected and could well be confusing for the user.\n3. After importing successfully (with latlong and all the rest) I was not able to use the import form to update rows - dryrun complained that objects already existed. That surprised me, we've tested that before - needs investigation.\n\nBut none of those are the errors you describe:\n\n**1. 500 error when including latlong**: I've no idea, as stated I could excel import using 'Name' from pndata.Location objects. I received user feedback of errors on dryrun when attempting to import with non-unique latlongs in column. Note that location_lat_long field is 'unique' (check your forwarded spreadsheet where the column of latlongs is not unique).\n\n**2. Spreadsheet should contain a Vineyardblock definition sheet**: Yes I understand this error, but provided the same title is used as for the downloaded skeleton spreadsheet - in this case \"Vineyard Block\" - then all is good on my instance. I don't understand why your instance should be requesting the title: Vineyardblock. Have definition names been changed on your instance?\n\n**3. Column ordering on spreadsheets**: This can be changed by editing the order of the provenance definition fields of the provenance definition in the admin. But you know that. The \"dump_provenance\" command preserves the ordering, but as you have noted, if the ordering has not been changed then the 'order' field is the default value, 0. You can verify this in the sauvignonblanc_dump.json file. So the ordering of columns is arbitrary until ordered.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nDarryl\n",

The crop analog is the Plant table but for the provenance context there could be more than one entity from which samples will be taken.\n\nAfter quizzing a few scientists around the place I have found that there is no generic word that means \"entity from which a sample is taken\". \nI had a flash of inspiration in the weekend and thought of the the word \"specimen\". It is not a direct match but it is close enough and, I think, manages to convey the meaning I want.\nSo in the spirit of computer (and other) scientists everywhere we are going to hijack the word specimen and redefine it as the \"entity from which a sample is taken\"... at least for within the Kea context.\n",

Something like this:\n\nCREATE DATABASE test_keadbdev TEMPLATE keadbdev;\n- There is an optional step to populate the elasticsearch indexes too. From memory the ES indexes get prefixed with test_ during the test suite run. They are not deleted when the test suite completes because they do take a long time to populate with data.\n- All integration tests are run against the test_keadbdev database.\n- test suite complete, integration test db is dropped.\n\nWith a copy of the dev/prod db and elasticsearch indexes the size required on disk ends up being  somewhat large. Hopefully that won't be a problem. I know when I've used travis-ci in the past there was a 3 GB disk limit which I think would be a problem here.\n",

This means form validation fails and you cannot save the form ever. If you want to save the form you need to do it in two steps\n1. change order from 1,2,3,4 to 20,40,30,10 for example\n2. Change from 20,40,30,10 back into 2,4,3,1\n\nThat is essentially what the hack of adding 1000 does. Because remember there is a unique constraint on the order column.\n\nWhere my little hack falls over is when you save the form and the form validation fails. When this happens the fields in the order column get incremented by 1000. This is because I need to increment the fields in the order table by 1000 before validating the form and when form validation fails the order is already saved. We could potentially subtract 1000 from the order and resave when the form fails it's validation. That might fix the problem.\n",

Instead it accepts everything and lets django models/database handle the validation which is why you get those lovely exception tracebacks.\n\nFor example, how the code handles integer fields\n1. Try convert the value to an integer\n2. If cannot convert return None\n\nIt is essentially ignoring errors. The only custom validation that we have there that I can see is the \"Missing!\" handler. This doesn't actually validate anything or prevent you from importing the data.\n\nSo, if you want validation without showing those exception tracebacks I think we would be looking at a custom solution built on top of the django-import-export library. That is unfortunately not a 5 minute job.\n",

This table is not a provenance table and causes the whole system to crash.\n\nThe provenance admin page (http://localhost:8000/provenance/admin/) shows a list of all of the tables in the provenance. The integrity tree code is what does this. This also follows any foreign keys that a provenance definition has. This is what detects the pndata.Location table and adds it to the list of models on the provenance admin page.\n\nThe NoReverseMatch exception is raised because the pndata.Location table is not registered in the django admin. The provenance admin page tries to include a link to the Location admin add page (which does not exist because the model is not registered in the admin).\n\nI did check the pndata/admin.py file and discovered that the LocationAdmin was originally registered in the admin but is now commented out. I am not sure of the reason for this so you will need to let me know.\n\nI did try enable the LocationAdmin class and the page did load but that uncovered more errors because the provenance admin page is not designed to handle non provenance models. The error was that the link to browse all records in the table did not work (datagrid). This is caused by the pndata.Location model is not a provenance model.\n\nWould like to get your thoughts on the best way to solve this problem.\n",

          "description": "Kea's Initialise Ebrida function was originally added for Kiwifruit sex testing. The Populations in the Ebrida generated spreadsheets had 'nice' numbers of plants (eg. 30, or 46, or 94, or 188), so that populations filled up plates nicely. The Groups column had 'nice' numbers too: 3x30, or 2x46, or 1x94, (populations x samples) so that each Group - meaning one Tray - corresponded to a full Kea plate. This worked nicely (or did, until the Ebrida spreadsheet formats all changed...). Things do not work so nicely when the numbers are not so 'nice'...\n\nOne example is in my issue #209 - Groups don't correspond to Plates when there are fewer than one population of 94 samples, or 2 populations of 46 samples, or 3 populations of 30 samples in a Group. Paradoxically, Mareike received an Ebrida spreadsheet where the entries in the Group column were the orchard position of the plant, and therefore every entry was unique. Initialising plates in Kea meant that each sample was put into its own plate. Although this was a while after I posted #209 and something may have changed since then?\n\nFor some harvests, there are only one or two samples from each population. Unchecking 'Leave two blank wells between populations' removes the two blank wells from the start of each plate, too. These two blank wells at the start of each plate should always be there.\n\nKea imposes a limit of _94 plants per Group_, even when there are no plates being collected (only bags or tubes), and even when no blank wells are to be left. The error message for exceeding this limit says there is a limit of _96 plants per Group_.\n\nThese issues are quite important: combined with the non-uniformity of the Ebrida spreadsheets themselves (column titles changing; Pedigree Item sometimes being Orchard Position and sometimes K14.018.001 or whatever; different date formats...), they mean that sometimes up to ten trial runs are needed on keatest to make sure things are going to work as expected. They have resulted in the creation of more than one rubbish Sample Batch, and there is still an Ebrida Sample Batch from October that I have been unable to create in Kea.\n",

The Kea platesheets I initialised a week or two ago from this spreadsheet puts the first half of the tray 224 samples into tray 223, and the second half of the tray 224 samples into the first half of tray 224.

The reason for this is I've recently switched over to debian (then ubuntu a week later... broken graphics drivers...) on my laptop and in order to easily do so I've needed to make my development environments more portable hence the switch to developing with docker. The advantage of this is that it takes minutes rather than hours to build myself a development environment from scratch. This change meant rather considerable changes to the repository structure so I branched it. This branch has vagrant stripped out replaced with docker and removed buildout to replace with pip. Feel free to take whatever you want from this branch but the pertinent code for this issue can be found in the commit referenced above.\n",

Assuming that the localid fields should not be editable via the api the model schema would need to be changed to set editable=False (same as pndata local ids) on all localid fields.\n\nAll provenance models should be tested through this endpoint to ensure that the api behaves as expected.\n",

An example of this is shown here. This option would need to be set per model as required.\n\nhttps://github.com/PlantandFoodResearch/Kea/commit/d5963aa97dbc5f6732a96c0fc8d54bca79155586#diff-667531a35968de880a4bb78b757ce449R52\n\nThe second approach was to make all m2m fields use the datagrid select mechanism in the admin. The code for this can be seen here\n\nhttps://github.com/PlantandFoodResearch/Kea/commit/d5963aa97dbc5f6732a96c0fc8d54bca79155586#diff-cbb7a1134e0bc33f63e1cafa2b3dbe6dR137\n\nThe correct approach is most likely a combination of these two. The datagrid select solves the clunky multi select widget and the default ordering sets the ordering of the model anywhere it is used that doesn't explicitly set it's own order.\n",

Perhaps you could point me at the particular datagrid that is causing the problem.\n\nIn regards to parsing of dates from excel import you should be able to configure the accepted formats by setting the DATE_INPUT_FORMATS and DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS. Django provides default values for these but they can be added to the base settings file and customized. django-import-export which does the excel parsing uses those settings to parse the date.\n\nI can discuss this further with you next week if you like.\n",

          "description": "Hi Kea dudes,\r\n\r\nSo I've just been initialising some samples for our annual(ish) apple harvest. This year it consists of two multi-population batches, each consisting of 20ish populations.\r\n\r\nThe data I receive in order to do this is a spreadsheet that looks something like:\r\n`Population | Mother               | Father               | Number`\r\n`AA0208      | A001R001T001 | A001R001T002 |        257`\r\n`AA0209     | A001R001T001 | A001R001T003 |        117`\r\n`...`\r\n\r\nwith one row per population, and one spreadsheet per sample batch. The Population column is to be a population altName; the Mother and Father columns are altNames of plants that may or may not exist in Kea, and may or may not have isParent = True; and the Number column is the number of plants in that population.\r\n\r\nCurrently to initialise these, I need to:\r\nMake a new list of unique parent altNames\r\nSearch Kea for plants by each altName, and check if each one exists\r\nIf a plant exists, check that it is isParents=TRUE\r\nIf it does not exist, create a genotype via the admin screen and add the altName, then create the plant via the admin screen and add the altName\r\nUsing the admin screen, create each population, each time searching the sample table for the parents and setting them as the parents, adding the population altNames; selecting the same Breeder and cross date every time.\r\nCreate the multi-population batch, selecting my new populations\r\nMake sure the generated spreadsheet lists them in the right order, and enter the number of plants for each population\r\n\r\nToday this has taken me over two hours so far. It strikes me that if I could just upload the above spreadsheet, and gave a bit of additional info like Breeder and Cross Date or whatever, the parents could be get_or_created or something, and isParent=TRUEed; and the populations created and given altNames; and the correct number of samples added automatically. And it would take about four seconds.\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n1. Is there currently a much quicker way to achieve all of this? (i.e. am I a moron?)\r\n2. Can I try to outsmart Kea somehow (probably not...) I mean can I manipulate this spreadsheet somehow to create a list of all the samples, and tell Kea it's an Ebrida spreadsheet and initialise it that way or something? (I'm guessing no, because the plants don't have Barcodes/LotIDs/PlotIDs/Locations/Social Security Numbers/EbridaPedigreeItems or whatever).\r\n3. Can something be added to Kea so that it understands this sort of spreadsheet?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike",

We are not taking any risk of loss. So, when we receive a potato variety in a tissue culture tub or as microtubers from Lincoln, we first multiply into 3 -4 tubs to get about 30-40  plantlets. For cryopreservation, we use 120 buds (both shoot tips and developed axillary buds). They go into: 4 cryo tubes each having 25 buds and another fifth with 20 buds. So we have 5 tubes in liquid nitrogen. One with 20 buds comes out after a week or so and get tested for viability and if we have >40  % viability, that variety is in permanent storage in 4 tubes.\r\n In the Dewar we have chambers A, B, C, D and within the chambers we have towers A-1, A2 … D1, D2 etc. Each tower has 12 positions which can take one cryo box each. Cryo boxes have their barcodes (box bar code  in sheet), can take 48 cryo tubes with barcode (tube barcode in sheet). For each cultivar we allocate two towers taking two tubes each. We have now placed 2 tubes per variety of 18 varieties in their final resting place. The other two tubes will be placed in another tower from their temporary storage position and the sheet will be updated. We also write down the position of each tube within the box.\r\nSo, for Kea, we can only identify the tube (not the individual 25 shoot tips in it) and link it to the variety. A variety will have four tubes in four different positions, using two boxes that are in two different towers.\r\n\r\nIn this case the material being stored is a viable plant (a specimen) so I think this should be modeled in the locations table (could also contain samples/sample-extracts). Obviously we cant track the individual plantlets in each tube but each tube could be treated as a single specimen (or other entity). ",

This is a (tree-like) recursive relationship between containers a locations. A container must have a location which could be a 'real' location or another container-location.\r\nThis would effectively be treating containers as a type of location that can be moved (taking its contents with it).\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n * More flexible model of the (fundamentally nested) nature of containers/locations\r\n * From the users point of view, there is a single (compulsory) option that states where a 'thing' is located\r\n * Existing Specimen's locations are unaffected as there is still a foreign key to location table\r\n * New specimens can have a container via the location table\r\n * Samples and Sample-extracts can still be forced to have a container (foreign key to container table) and are unaffected \r\n\r\nCons:\r\n * Potential for deeply nested structures\r\n   - probably no more than three levels deep in practice\r\n   - can be presented to users like a breadcrumb trail?\r\n * Risk of infinite recursion (a container inside itself)\r\n   - disallow it in the code?\r\n\r\nPlease criticise ",

The company/purported variety should be inherited from the sac\r\n\r\n### feature\r\n\r\nIn a provenance models when defining foreign key (maybe via a TemplateForeignKey class) you can specify inherited/template fields as key-value pairs.\r\nThe data from those fields are then automatically filled out in the gui (but can be manually changed).\r\n\r\nThis may be simpler to implement only for recursive foreign keys.\r\n",
